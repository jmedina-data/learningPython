# type of data structure
# tuple is similar to a list
# tuples are immutable - cannot be changed

# list uses []
# tuples use () and CANNOT be changed
# data thats never gonna change are stored in tuples. ex. coordinates.
# coordinates arent gonna change.

coordinates = (4, 5)

print(coordinates[1])

# you can make a list of tuples
coordinates2 = (4, 5), (6, 7), (80, 34)
